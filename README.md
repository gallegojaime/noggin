# Noggin
The frictionless knowledge manager.

> Noggin is what you know taken into a machine-friendly version of it.

## A little inspiration
We foresee a future in which users wield computing power to manage and optimize their understanding of the world.
Through noggin, a user can manage their knowledge from a short Math's syllabus to every individual skill.

Which prerequisites should I learn to reach this skill? What is the best way to get there? Your computer and the community should be able to answer those questions.

## Make it frictionless
Everything you know is a lot. You should not expect to input every skill in Noggin, even though you could do it manually.
APIs and open-sourcing can make it happen; imagine Khan Academy appending new skills when you learn them!

## What about certification?
Schools and jobs will not be impressed by a bunch of self-reported data. Therefore, it is a goal of ours to add respected certifications to the Noggin structures.

## Use cases
*Self-reporting of one or more skill tracks, for reference and analysis.

*Navigation of skill tracks, Noggin- or user-published, to learn anything and provide immense situational awareness.

*Embedding of Noggin data into jobs pages, so that employers can gauge fitness, hire faster, and develop strategies (hire a team with diverse sets of skills, or concentrated...).
